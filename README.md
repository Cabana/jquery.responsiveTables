# responsive-data-tables

CSS and JS for quickly doing responsive data tables

## How to use

The plugin assumes you have nice HTML to work with. Something like this

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Table Header</th>
      <th>Table Header</th>
      <th>Table Header</th>
      <th>Table Header</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>This is longer content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>This is longer content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>This is longer content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>This is longer content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
      <td>Content</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

If the table doesn't contain a thead element then the javascript will construct one from the first tr in tbody.

Then just include the javascript and css on the page and you should be good to go.
